# Image_Recognition_Face_Attendance_System-Project


The project is an attendance system that uses face recognition technology to mark the attendance of individuals in real-time. The system uses a webcam to capture the images of individuals and then compares them with the pre-stored images to recognize and mark the attendance of individuals.

The project is implemented in Python programming language using the OpenCV and face_recognition libraries. The system can recognize multiple faces and mark the attendance of individuals by storing their names and time of attendance in a CSV file.

The system can be used in various settings such as schools, universities, offices, etc. where attendance needs to be marked regularly. The system eliminates the need for traditional attendance systems that are prone to errors and can save a lot of time and effort for the management.

To make the system more user-friendly, the project can be further extended to create a web interface that can display the attendance records, generate reports, and provide real-time attendance monitoring.
